                <hr>
                <p>A <strong>board game</strong> is a type of <strong>tabletop game</strong> that involves small objects (game pieces) that are placed and moved in particular ways on a specially designed patterned <strong>game board</strong>, potentially including other components, e.g. dice. The earliest known uses of the term "board game" are between the 1840s and 1850s.</p>

                <p>While game boards are a <strong>necessary and sufficient condition</strong> of this <strong>genre, card games</strong> that do not use a standard deck of cards, as well as games that use neither cards nor a game board, are often colloquially included, with some referring to this genre generally as "table and board games" or simply "tabletop games".</p>

                <h3>Ancient era</h3>
                <p>Board games have been played, traveled, and evolved in most cultures and societies throughout history Board games have been discovered in a number of archaeological sites. The oldest discovered gaming pieces were discovered in southwest Turkey, a set of elaborate sculptured stones in sets of four designed for a chess-like game, which were created during the <strong>Bronze Age</strong> around 5,000 years ago. Numerous archaeological finds of game boards exist that date from as early as the <strong>Neolithic</strong> period including, as of 2024, a total of 14 Neolithic sites reporting 51 game boards, ranging from <strong>mid-7th millennium</strong> to early <strong>8th millennium</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Oldest game</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Royal Game of Ur</strong>, estimated to have originated from around 4,600 years ago in ancient <strong>Mesopotamia</strong>, an example of which was found in the royal tombs of ancient Mesopotamia (c.2600 BC a c.2400 BC), is considered the oldest playable boardgame in the world, with well-defined game's rules discovered written on a cuneiform tablet by a Babylonian astronomer in c.177 BC a c.176 BC.</p>

                <p>Currently, <strong>Senet</strong> is argued to be the oldest known board game in the world, with possible game board fragments (c.3100 BC) and undisputed pictorial representations (c.2686;BC a c.2613 BC) having been found in Predynastic and First Dynasty burials dating as far back as 3500 BC. However, while Senet was played for thousands of years, it fell out of fashion sometime after 400 A.D. during the <strong>Roman period</strong>; the rules were never written down, therefore they are not decisively known. Similarly, <u>Mehen</u> is one of the oldest games dated with reasonable confidence, i.e., c.3000 BC a c.2300 BC, with some estimating it dates back to c.3500 BC. The rules, scoring system, and game pieces, however, are unknown or speculative.</p>

                <p>The title of the oldest known board game has been difficult to establish. An example of this is <strong>mancala</strong>, which includes a broad family of board games with a core design of two rows of small circular divots or bowls carved into a surface, which has had numerous estimations of its generic age due to the many variants that have been discovered in different locations across Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. These are dated across many different historical periods, from archaeological sites dating the game at c.800 BC a c.200 BC (Roman Settlements); c.2500 BC a c.1500 BC (Egypt); and even c.7000  BC a c.5000  BC (Jordan). The later based on divots carved out of <strong>limestone</strong> in a Neolithic dwelling from c.5870  BC ¬± 240 BC, although this later dating has been disputed. Furthermore, when considering the Neolithic period game boards discoveries, caution has been given against considering these finds as representing earliest human game playing, as the absence of evidence of such games does not equate to evidence that no games were played during earlier periods.</p>

                <h3>Golden era</h3>
                <p>The 1880s‚Äì1920s was a board game epoch known as the "Golden Age", a term coined by American art historian Margaret Hofer where the popularity of board games was boosted through <strong>mass production</strong> making them cheaper and more readily available. The most popular of the board games sold during this period was <strong><i>Monopoly</i></strong> (1935), with 500 million games played as of 1999.</p>

                <h3>Renaissance era</h3>
                <p>In the late 1990s, companies began producing more new games to serve a growing worldwide market.The early 21st century saw the emergence of a new "Golden Age" for board games called the "Board Game Renaissance". This period of board games industry development, of which board games such as <strong><i>Ticket to Ride</i></strong> (2004) and were a major part, saw a shift away from the 20th-century domination by well-established standby Golden Era board games like <strong><i>Monopoly</i></strong> (1935) and <strong><i>Game of Life</i></strong> (1960).</p>

                <h2 id="luck">Luck, strategy, and diplomacy</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Some games, such as chess, depend completely on player skill, while many children's games such as <strong><i>Candy Land</i></strong> (1949) and <strong>snakes and ladders</strong> require no decisions by the players and are decided purely by luck.</p>

                <p>Many games require some level of both skill and luck. A player may be hampered by bad luck in <strong>backgammon</strong>, <strong><i>Monopoly</i></strong>, or <strong><i>Risk</i></strong>; but over many games, a skilled player will win more often. The elements of luck can also make for more excitement at times, and allow for more diverse and multifaceted strategies, as concepts such as <strong>expected value</strong> and <strong>risk management</strong> must be considered.</p>

                <p>Luck may be introduced into a game by several methods. The use of <strong>dice</strong> of various sorts goes back to one of the earliest board games, the <strong>Royal Game of Ur</strong>. These can decide everything from how many steps a player moves their token, as in Monopoly, to how their forces fare in battle, as in Risk, or which resources a player gains, as in <strong><i>Catan</i></strong> (1995). Other games such as <strong><i>Sorry!</i></strong> (1934) use a deck of special <u>cards</u> that, when shuffled, create randomness. Scrabble (1948) creates a similar effect using randomly picked letters. Other games use spinners, timers of random length, or other sources of randomness. <strong>German-style board games</strong> are notable for often having fewer elements of luck than many North American board games. Luck may be reduced in favor of skill by introducing symmetry between players. For example, in a dice game such as <strong><i>Ludo</i></strong> (c.1896), by giving each player the choice of rolling the dice or using the previous player's roll.</p>

                <p>Another important aspect of some games is diplomacy, that is, players, making deals with one another. Negotiation generally features only in games with three or more players, <strong>cooperative games</strong> being the exception. An important facet of Catan, for example, is convincing players to trade with you rather than with opponents. <strong><i>In Risk</i></strong>, two or more players may team up against others. <strong><i>Easy</i></strong> diplomacy involves convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against. Advanced diplomacy (e.g., in the aptly named game <strong>Diplomacy</strong> from 1954) consists of making elaborate plans together, with the possibility of betrayal.</p>

                <p>In <strong>perfect information</strong> games, such as chess, each player has complete information on the state of the game, but in other games, such as <strong>Tigris and Euphrates</strong> (1997) or <strong>Stratego</strong> (1946), some information is hidden from players. This makes finding the best move more difficult and may involve estimating probabilities by the opponents.</p>
